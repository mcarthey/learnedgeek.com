When customers finish eating, dirty dishes pile up.\n\nOption 1: Stack them and wait for the dishwasher to clean them in bulk\nOption 2: Wash each dish immediately\n\nMost programming languages work like Option 1. They have a \u0022dishwasher\u0022 called the garbage collector (GC).\n\nThat works great... until you get really busy.\n\nCustomers keep coming. Dishes keep piling up. The dishwasher can\u0027t keep up.\n\nEventually, you run out of clean dishes. The kitchen grinds to a halt.\n\nThis is a memory leak.\n\nIn programming, there are two types of trash:\n\n1. Regular trash (memory) - Paper plates. Can wait for the GC.\n2. Special trash (resources) - Dishes with food still on them. Need immediate cleanup.\n\nFile handles, network connections, database connections \u2014 these are \u0022dishes.\u0022 If you don\u0027t clean them immediately, you run out.\n\nThe fix: Explicit cleanup. In C#, that\u0027s \u0060using\u0060 statements.\n\nOur production leak: We forgot to \u0022wash our dishes\u0022 for 2 years. Five \u0060using\u0060 statements fixed it.\n\nThe dishwasher isn\u0027t magic. Sometimes you have to wash your own dishes.\n\n#programming #eli5 #memoryleak #explained"

So I figured, I work with SVGs all the time for my blog... why not just build the cards myself?\n\nTurns out print design is a completely different world from web design. Things I had no clue about going in:\n\n- Bleed margins (your design extends past the cut line in case the trim is slightly off)\n- Safe zones (keep important stuff away from edges)\n- 300 DPI vs 96 DPI (screen resolution looks terrible in print)\n- Spot UV finishing requires a separate mask file \u2014 black where you want gloss, white everywhere else\n\nThe biggest surprise? Inkscape\u0027s XML editor. Being able to directly edit SVG attributes \u2014 opacity, letter-spacing, fills, node ordering \u2014 was faster than navigating menus. Felt like using browser DevTools but for print design.\n\nWould I recommend this approach? Only if you enjoy learning by doing. It took longer than a template wizard, but I understand print design now in a way I wouldn\u0027t have otherwise.\n\n#inkscape #design #printdesign #opensource #learningbydoing"
