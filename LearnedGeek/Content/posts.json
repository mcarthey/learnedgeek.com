      "linkedInHook": "Why do programs leak memory?\n\nImagine running a restaurant kitchen. When customers finish eating, dirty dishes pile up.\n\nOption 1: Stack them and wait for the dishwasher to clean them in bulk\nOption 2: Wash each dish immediately\n\nMost programming languages work like Option 1. They have a \"dishwasher\" called the garbage collector (GC).\n\nThat works great... until you get really busy.\n\nCustomers keep coming. Dishes keep piling up. The dishwasher can't keep up.\n\nEventually, you run out of clean dishes. The kitchen grinds to a halt.\n\nThis is a memory leak.\n\nIn programming, there are two types of trash:\n\n1. Regular trash (memory) - Paper plates. Can wait for the GC.\n2. Special trash (resources) - Dishes with food still on them. Need immediate cleanup.\n\nFile handles, network connections, database connections — these are \"dishes.\" If you don't clean them immediately, you run out.\n\nThe fix: Explicit cleanup. In C#, that's `using` statements.\n\nOur production leak: We forgot to \"wash our dishes\" for 2 years. Five `using` statements fixed it.\n\nThe dishwasher isn't magic. Sometimes you have to wash your own dishes.\n\n#programming #eli5 #memoryleak #explained"

Badly.\n\nWe had 200+ controllers following this pattern. Every single one leaked HttpResponseMessage objects.\n\nThe problem: Web API's disposal contract differs by return type.\n\n• Return IHttpActionResult → Web API disposes for you ✅\n• Return HttpResponseMessage → You must dispose manually ⚠️\n\nThis isn't documented clearly. Microsoft's own examples show the leaking pattern.\n\nUnder load (100+ req/sec):\n• Before fix: 2,257 HttpResponseMessage instances leaked\n• After fix: < 100 instances\n\nProduction impact:\n• 12 instances → 6 instances (50% cost reduction)\n• Zero timeout errors\n• Stable memory\n\nThe fix: Change return types to IHttpActionResult.

So I figured, I work with SVGs all the time for my blog... why not just build the cards myself?\n\nTurns out print design is a completely different world from web design. Things I had no clue about going in:\n\n- Bleed margins (your design extends past the cut line in case the trim is slightly off)\n- Safe zones (keep important stuff away from edges)\n- 300 DPI vs 96 DPI (screen resolution looks terrible in print)\n- Spot UV finishing requires a separate mask file — black where you want gloss, white everywhere else\n\nThe biggest surprise? Inkscape's XML editor. Being able to directly edit SVG attributes — opacity, letter-spacing, fills, node ordering — was faster than navigating menus. Felt like using browser DevTools but for print design.\n\nWould I recommend this approach? Only if you enjoy learning by doing. It took longer than a template wizard, but I understand print design now in a way I wouldn't have otherwise.\n\n#inkscape #design #printdesign #opensource #learningbydoing"
