# 2025 Was Draft Year. 2026 Is Edit Year. Here's the Plan.

Tonight at 7 PM Central, I'm joining Novel90's Spring 2026 cohort. Ninety days to turn a messy first draft into something publishable.

I almost didn't write this post. It feels like tempting fate—announcing a goal before you've achieved it. But accountability is the whole point. If I'm going to do this thing, I might as well do it publicly.

## The Year of the Draft

2025 was about getting words on paper. Any words. Terrible words. Words that made me cringe when I reread them two months later.

The first draft of my novel exists. It has a beginning, a middle, and an end. Characters do things. Plot happens. Some of it might even be good.

But a first draft isn't a book. A first draft is a lump of clay that vaguely resembles a book. It needs to be shaped, smoothed, and probably thrown at the wall a few times.

## Why Novel90?

AutoCrit's Novel90 challenge is a 90-day structured editing program. You commit to consistent daily work on your manuscript—not sprints, not marathons, just showing up every day for three months.

The accountability piece is what sold me. Left to my own devices, I'll find reasons to procrastinate. There's always grading to catch up on. Client work that needs attention. A codebase that could use refactoring.

Novel90 creates external structure. Daily check-ins. A cohort of other writers at the same stage. A deadline that isn't self-imposed.

## The Reality Check

I'm starting this challenge in the middle of a busy semester. I teach database programming at a technical college. I'm building a field service app for a client. I have a day job. I have responsibilities.

Here's the thing: there will never be a perfect time.

The planets will never align. The schedule will never clear. If I wait for an empty calendar, I'll be waiting forever.

So I'm doing this *alongside* everything else. Not instead of. Alongside.

## The Math

Ninety days. February through April 2026.

If I edit for 45 minutes a day—about the length of one episode of television I'm not watching—that's 67.5 hours of focused editing time.

Sixty-seven hours on a manuscript I've already written. That's not nothing. That's a significant investment in making this thing real.

## What I'm Not Doing

I'm not trying to write the next great American novel. I'm trying to finish what I started.

I'm not aiming for perfection. I'm aiming for "good enough to submit."

I'm not using AI to rewrite my prose. (That's a whole other post. The short version: ChatGPT is great for brainstorming, terrible for maintaining voice, and catastrophic for continuity. I once watched it change my protagonist's job mid-chapter because it thought it would "add spice." It did not add spice. It added confusion.)

## The Commitment

Here's what I'm committing to:

1. **Show up daily.** Even if it's just 15 minutes on a brutal day.
2. **Track progress publicly.** I'll share updates here—the wins, the walls, the moments when I want to delete everything.
3. **Finish.** Not "finish if it's convenient." Finish.

## Why This Matters

I don't watch television. Not as a flex—as a trade. The hours most people spend on Netflix, I spend building things. Code. Furniture. Gardens. Words.

This is my entertainment. This is what I do instead of consuming. I create.

A novel has been on my list for years. 2025 was about proving I could write one. 2026 is about proving I can finish one.

Tonight at 7 PM, the clock starts.

See you on the other side.
